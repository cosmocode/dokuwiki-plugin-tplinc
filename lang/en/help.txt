As pattern you can use the following:

  * For a single page just specify its full page id
  * For namespaces excluding subnamespaces use ''%%namespace:*%%''
  * For namespaces including subnamespaces use ''%%namespace:**%%''
  * Regular Expressions can be used starting and ending with ''/'' - they are matched against a '':'' prefixed full page id

Pages can optionally be given as relative IDs and will be resolved against the current page's namespace. When matching
regular expressions, matched groups can be reused in the inserted page name by referencing them as ''$0'', ''$1'', ..., ''$n''.

By default only pages that the current user has read access for are included. You can use the **Skip ACL** option to
always include pages.
